# Figures & Margin Content

When using **msmbstyle** you can make use of all the plot configuration settings that are provided by [**bookdown**](https://www.bookdown.org) and [**tufte**](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte), including references, figure captions, and margin figures.

The examples shown below are taken directly from the **tufte** vignette (https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/) to demonstrate how they are styled by **msmbstyle**.

## Margin Figures

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures in the margin you can use the **knitr** chunk option `fig.margin = TRUE`. For example:

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(
  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
)
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

Note the use of the `fig.cap` chunk option to provide a figure caption. You can adjust the proportions of figures using the `fig.width` and `fig.height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.

```{r, wait, cache = TRUE}
Sys.sleep(10)
```
